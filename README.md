Load website into Electron and use local CSS and JavaScript files

# Electron Web Loader

This is a basic Electron application that demonstrates how to load an external website and inject multiple local CSS and JavaScript files into it. This project serves as a starting point for building desktop applications using web technologies.

## Features

- Load an external website in an Electron window.
- Inject local CSS files for custom styling.
- Inject local JavaScript files for additional functionality.
- Basic project structure for easy customization.

## Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (including npm)
- Electron

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

You can clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/electron-diff-css-js.git
cd electron-diff-css-js
```

Replace `yourusername` with your GitHub username.

### 2. Install Dependencies

Navigate to the project directory and install the required npm packages by running:

```
npm init -y
npm install electron
```

### 3. Project Structure

Your project should have the following structure:

```
electron-app/
│
├── main.js                  # Main process file
├── preload.js               # Preload script
├── package.json             # NPM configuration file
├── styles/                  # Folder for CSS files
│   ├── style1.css           # Local CSS file 1
│   └── style2.css           # Local CSS file 2
├── scripts/                 # Folder for JavaScript files
│   ├── script1.js           # Local JS file 1
│   └── script2.js           # Local JS file 2
└── index.html               # HTML file for Electron (optional)
```

### 4. Run the Application

To start the Electron application, use the following command:

```
npm start
```

This will open the Electron window and load the specified external URL (`https://example.com`).

### 5. Customizing the Application

- **Adding CSS and JavaScript**: You can add more local CSS and JavaScript files in the `styles` and `scripts` folders, respectively. Update the paths in `main.js` to inject your new files.
- **Changing the External URL**: Edit the URL in `main.js` to load a different website or a local HTML file.

### 6. Package the Application

To package your Electron application for distribution, you can use packages like [electron-packager](https://github.com/electron/electron-packager) or [electron-builder](https://www.electron.build/). Install one of these packages and follow their documentation for further instructions.
